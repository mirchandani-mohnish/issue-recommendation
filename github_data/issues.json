Selection and copy of the original (`DiffResult::Left`) code from the diff view would make this straight-forward. Currently, these lines are invisible for selection.\r\n\r\nThe behavior for selections starting on `DiffResult::Both` or `DiffResult::Right` should remain. When placing the cursor or starting selection on `DiffResult::Left`, the other side (`DiffResult::Right`) should become invisible for this specific selection.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when pressing the `Down` or `Up` keys (without selection), I think all lines should be considered. But this isn't really important as long as the selection can be started on `DiffResult::Left` with the mouse.\r\n\r\nThis will make it impossible to select fragments of the original code that do not start or end inside modified lines.

Added a regression test.</li>\n<li>Fixed a panic when transforming webp images. Added a regression test.</li>\n<li>Added a check to prevent integer overflow when calculating file size for BMP\nimages. The missing check could panic in debug mode or else set an incorrect\nfile size in release mode.</li>\n<li>Upgraded the PNG image encoder to use the newer <code>PngEncoder::write_image</code>\ninstead of the deprecated <code>PngEncoder::encode</code> which did not account for byte\norder and could result in images with incorrect colors.</li>\n<li>Fixed <code>InsufficientMemory</code> error when trying to decode a PNG image.</li>\n<li>Fix warnings and CI issues.</li>\n<li>Typos and links in the documentation have been corrected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added check for dynamic image dimensions before resizing.

        "body": "It would be nice to split Lapce into smaller crates.  \r\n- Avoid confusing dependencies between various bits of code\r\n- Avoid the really big files that do many different things (ex: tab.rs)\r\n- Help with compile time, since a more crate-based breaking up would let Rust have an easier time applying the incremental compilation and parallelization it does\r\n  - How much would this actually help? What are we bottlenecking on?\r\n- Potentially help with writing tests of UI elements?\r\n- When we switch to Xilem, if it is easier to ignore certain parts (because they're more isolated to their crates) then that might make a more gradual translation easier\r\n- This can be relatively gradual, so don't have to do one big 20k line PR\r\n\r\nThe idea would be a breakup of the various 'parts' (ex: completion, palette, hover, etc) into their own crates. That would be nice and relatively natural way to break the crates up, because they are relatively independent from each other.  \r\nThen, if we ever make a `MarkdownView` then that can be in its own crate which completion's documentation and the hover could both depend on but palette doesn't need to know about. Of course, there'd be very common shared crates of common functionality (like many widgets need to depend on the interface for the proxy).\r\n\r\nCurrently there's two main parts that I think are stopping us from doing this easily:\r\n\r\n# `LapceUICommand`\r\n`LapceUICommand` has a bunch of commands for all the different widgets.  \r\nHowever, I think this could be better handled by breaking it up into smaller enums.  \r\n\r\nMy main idea is to be to just have `LapceUICommand` disappear, and let each crate (like completion, palette, editor etc) define their own [Selectors](https://github.com/lapce/lapce/blob/master/lapce-data/src/command.rs#L61) for their own commands.  \r\nThere are probably commands on that which are 'general purpose', and so should be moved to their own enum that any crates which need it, can use.  \r\n\r\nThankfully, this sort of thing is actually easy enough to do gradually. We can just slowly make the commands defined in the various modules, and then once we have done that then we can remove the `LapceUICommand` enum. Then move the modules to their own crates.\r\n\r\nSelectors would also help in having private internal events (like for the completion sending out the event that has the updated completion items) and outside events that are meant to be sent by the outside (?example? Focus?) and events that are sent by the widget (ListItemSelected) all logically separate.\r\n\r\n# `LapceTabData`\r\nCurrently our method for storing data is to have a single `LapceTabData` structure, but that has obvious problems for this plan: it makes all the structures in other crates accessible.  \r\n  \r\nHowever we can avoid this by having more granular data structures. This is, actually, the style that Druid encourages you to use; which we've been ignoring, for the most part, since it was easier to just put everything on `LapceTabData`.  \r\n  \r\nOkay, so how do we do this?  \r\nAll widgets need access to `config` for colors, whether certain things are enabled, fonts, etc. (We could make config granular, but I don't think there's much benefit, so I think we should leave it as-is)  \r\nMost widgets need at least their data, but there are definitely widgets which need another widget's data. This can be passed to them by their containing widget, but we have to figure out how to design it\r\n\r\n## Updating Held Data\r\nWe could do like what I have in my `List` implementation. There's an extra function to update the data held by the widget.  \r\nAs a sketch:\r\n```rust\r\nstruct ListData {\r\n    config: Arc<LapceConfig>,\r\n\r\n    items: Vec<String>,\r\n}\r\n// Then in something using the list, like a root node, but you'd have to do this for every widget to pass it down!\r\nimpl Widget<LapceTabData> for Something {\r\n    fn event(&mut self, ctx: &mut EventCtx, event: &Event, data: &mut LapceTabData, env: &Env) {\r\n        let list_data: &mut ListData = &mut data.some_list_data;\r\n        list_data.config = data.config;\r\n\r\n        self.list.event(ctx, event, list_data, env);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn update(&mut self, ctx: &mut UpdateCtx, old_data: &LapceTabData, data: &LapceTabData, env: &Env) {\r\n        let list_data: &ListData = &data.some_list_data;\r\n        // Update could be called without an event, but we still want to give the latest config information\r\n        // (and for other widgets, there'd be more information to keep 'live')\r\n\r\n        // The clone could be deliberately designed to be cheap, which would perhaps be fine since druid encourages that\r\n        let mut list_data = list_data.clone();\r\n        list_data.config = data.config;\r\n\r\n        self.list.update(ctx, old_data, &list_data, env);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhich would work, but is uncomfortably verbose. Imagine writing that every single time you want to update the data a widget needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Just Tuple It?\r\nWhat if we just shove the different pieces of data into a tuple?  \r\n```rust\r\nimpl Widget<(LapceConfig, PaletteData)> for Palette {\r\n    fn event(&mut self, ctx: &mut EventCtx, event: &Event, data: &mut (LapceConfig, PaletteData), env: &Env) {\r\n        let (config, palette) /*: (&mut LapceConfig, &mut PaletteData) */ = data;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhich works.  \r\nBut how do you create them?  \r\nIf you have an existing `&mut LapceConfig` and `&mut PaletteData` separately (like on `LapceTabData` then you *cannot* just do `(&mut config, &mut palette)`.  \r\n(Somewhat incomplete section for this)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Traits Method\r\nIt might be better to instead do a trait method.  \r\n```rust\r\ntrait LapceData: druid::Data {\r\n    fn config(&self) -> &LapceConfig;\r\n\r\n    fn config_mut(&mut self) -> &mut LapceConfig;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnything can implement this, including `LapceTabData`.  \r\nWe can then have extensions of it, like `LapceDataCompletion` which has an extra function for getting the completion data. Th\r\n```rust\r\ntrait LapceDataCompletion: LapceData {\r\n    fn completion(&self) -> &CompletionData;\r\n\r\n    fn completion_mut(&mut self) -> &mut CompletionData;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhich we can also implement on `LapceTabData`.  \r\nThen completion would just do:  \r\n```rust\r\nimpl<T: LapceDataCompletion> Widget<T> for Completion {\r\n    fn event(&mut self, ctx: &mut EventCtx, event: &Event, data: &mut T, env: &Env) {\r\n        let config = data.config();\r\n        let completion = data.completion_mut();\r\n        /* ... */\r\n    }\r\n\r\n        /* ... */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Issue #1:** Multiple borrows. Since these are only accessible through the trait, we can't make it clear that `data.completion_mut()` and `data.config_mut()` are (in our case) disjoint mutable borrows.\r\n**Issue #2:** Compiling. If a good chunk of the logic is behind a generic implementation, then that just pushes most of the work to the part of the build where it actually gets that type. That probably kills a good chunk of any compile time benefit we might get.\r\n\r\n## Passing Events around for information\r\nSome of the usage of `LapceTabData` could be avoided by sending events with information. Like telling widgets that care (so they register their widget id for events?) what the active editor + cursor position is. Then it sends an event out about what to do with that.  \r\nThis can't implement nicely all the logic needed, though, only some parts of it.\r\n\r\n## Okay, that's all kinds of 'ehhhh' in terms of solutions\r\nWell, there's one more thing we can do.  \r\nWe could switch to using `Env`.  \r\nDruid's `Env` is basically doing all of what we are doing with `Config`, but it is already passed everywhere. We could just declare a bunch of [Key](https://docs.rs/druid/0.7.0/druid/struct.Key.html)s for the config items, and set them whenever the config changes. This would allow us to avoid passing around the config, and thus *somewhat* side-steps the issue of passing in the right data.  \r\nThis would be somewhat tedious the first-time, but future times would be pretty easy. Could even write a macro to generate most of the logic, thus simplifying the addition of a new config field.  \r\nMost of the widgets don't need to couple multiple pieces of data together!\r\nExample: Completion just needs the config, and the completion data. So if we make configuration accessed through `Env`, then we only need to pass the completion data to it. It has one part which directly uses main split, but that can (and should) just be an event in the first place.  \r\n\r\nUpdating the config would then be done through commands, since you rarely actually edit the config structure directly.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n- Breaking up most of lapce-data/lapce-ui into separate crates would be helpful\r\n- `LapceUICommand` is a partial blocker due to the central nature of it\r\n  - Can be better done with [Selectors](https://github.com/lapce/lapce/blob/master/lapce-data/src/command.rs#L61) that are defined by the crates themselves\r\n- `LapceTabData` is passed around as the *main* data currently, but we can be more specific\r\n  - This has some challenges, but we can work around them by switching to `Env` for config\r\n\r\n# Other Tidbits\r\n## Keeping lapce-data and lapce-ui separate\r\nShould we keep lapce-data and lapce-ui separate anymore?  \r\nPreviously, that was presumably done for some of the benefits of splitting into crates that I mentioned above. However, if we're splitting (for example) completion into its own crate, then there's less reason to have the data in a completely separate compile unit.\r\n## Env Key Perf\r\nEnv key's are just `&'static str`s into a hashmap, so they should be relatively cheap (and the hashing should hopefully be done at compile time). However, they are certainly going to be less efficient than just accessing a field off of a struct.  \r\nIf it becomes a remotely notable problem, then I expect there to be optimizations that we can do to avoid strings and instead use a `u64` or something. \r\nLike a macro that takes our list of config keys and generates a `u64` for each one, and then we can use that as the key. Modifies druid of course.  \r\n## Wacky Idea: Modify druid to pass `LapceConfig` around in `Env`  \r\nThis would obviously require modifying druid, but since we already have a fork then we could just do this. The main pain point is making druid depend on our config crate, and then our UI code depending on that druid crate. Which I'm unsure if that even works with it being out of our workspace tree.  \r\n(Probably we'd make it a field on `Env` just to make things easy, and not have to modify any stuff that actually uses `Env` for its purpose.)",

Everything else works fine, only the window dragging is bugged.\r\n\r\nAnd by \"it doesn't work\" I mean pressing and dragging the mouse on the window title doesn't do anything - the window doesn't move. Window resizing works fine.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nDisabling the \"custom titlebar\" in Lapce settings is a workaround.\r\n\r\nSwitching the primary button back to the LEFT button fixes the issue. This is where you can find the primary mouse button settings on Windows 10:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2076742/211997822-fed96f2f-12f5-4e9e-b170-291153d3475b.png)\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\nI have multiple toolchains that use different LSP servers. For example, when compiling with the msvc toolchain, I'm using clang-cl with a clangd installation somewhere in `C:\\Program Files\\LLVM\\bin`. When compiling with MSYS2, I'm using UCRT/Clang64 with a clangd located in `C:\\Users\\computerquip\\tools\\msys64\\clang64\\bin\\clangd.exe`. I don't seem to have a convenient way to switch between these two locations (and their associated arguments) when I need to use one over the other.\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThe word \"profiles\" comes to mind where you can just select a profile that changes out certain settings.  I think this is what vscode does but not sure.\r\n\r\n## Other Problems\r\nEven if such a feature is provided, I'd be surprised if there wasn't difficulty by just switching settings since it would require rebuilding the LSP database which probably isn't ideal. Maybe need data to be contextual to the profile, so if you switch profiles, it also knows where to find the database that was generated with that profile. This sounds like a can of worms when you have a bunch of different profiles and probably is. I'm unsure how vscode solves this (or if they try to solve it at all).\r\n\r\nAnyways, I feel like this is a pretty petty feature request. \r\n\r\n",
